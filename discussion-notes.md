# Notes
## On general principles and ethics
* This is not a democracy.
  * We might want it to be, we might strive for it to be, but the work is early and incremental and there is potential for abuse of admin power.
* Unfortunately, where we are at right now, membership must trust admins collectively and individually not to abuse technical or social power.
* There's a lot to fix, and the admin team is trying to get to it.
* There are concerns that nothing will change or get done.
* There are concerns that documentation will not help.
* The admin team shares these concerns, but is pressing forward, on the hope that documentation will lead to clearer, more transparent standards and expectations, incrementally helping the community despite these concerns.
* There is also membership support for this effort, despite concerns.
* The existence of quorum helps reassure membership too.

## On admin team recruitment
* We should set up a process/policy and document it for admin interview and acceptance.
  * Possible structure: each admin ask one question, deliberate, decide.
* Add section to admin document on community or admin team admin selection process.
* Current practice not democratic. Private indications of interest. Admin team deliberates and accepts or rejects. No rubric.
* Admins could ask membership for opinions on admins they want to accept.
  * "We are adding X to our team" vs "We are considering adding X to our team. X volunteered and presents a valuable perspective etc. If anyone has objections or questions you have X days to let us know."

## On admin team changes/removals/no confidence
* Provide a suggested path for removing admins
  * e.g. "if you want an admin removed, you can start a petition, and the other admins will consider it"

## On member reticence to comment on proposals for fear of retaliation
* A clear, possibly anonymous way to send complaints and feedback.
* Separate office outside admin power structure that does mediation.
  * How do we staff/maintain it?
* Increase transparency about complaints made about admins.
* Increase transparency about admin actions and interventions.
  * Unclear whether this suggestion was made with awareness of admin teams to use #admin-log and #announcements per current draft of admin doc.

## On community involvement
* Call for allies for disability justice work.
* Call for allies for antiracism justice work.
* Monthly sensitivity community discussion (not limited to major -ism concerns, could definitely be special/further marginalized topics and communities)?

## On getting the community more inclusive
* This will create tension and friction.
* This will take trust/respect to get through.

## On admin terms limits and related
* People seem interested in admin team term limits.
  * @kalessin: We might want to have a clause that accounts for if there aren't enough volunteers and what to do then, also a minimum target of admins on the team?
  * Might be good to have it be a periodic review - "decide if you want to serve as admin again".
* Institute a block-out time after ending a term (voluntarily or not)?

## On increasing trust given no current self-governance and no democracy
* Increase transparency in general.
* Increase documentation.
* Public record of complaints against individual admins.

## On admin practice and policy
* Admins should limit interventions to CoC violations, not "patterns" which are too judgemental, subjective, and at risk of labeling individuals as "The Problem".
* If possible, admins should step in before someone violates a code if possible and prompt them to stop.

## On unfair and unjustified permanent bans as part of fear or retaliation for speaking out, as well as other concerns
* There is currently no recourse.
  * Some members have only this slack to rely on for queer community, so there's a sense of great potential loss.
  * The current admin team understands and sympathizes with this, and many individuals on the team have direct personal invesment in the slack and a lot to lose as well.
* Expectations:
  * Bannable code violations are all in the Code of Conduct. The admin team and individuals cannot make and do not cultivate poor relations with individual members. Personal grudges are not okay. We expect any admin in that situation to recuse themselves and deescalate where possible.
* Process:
  * Formal process for notifying banned members.
  * Template for notification.
  * Probably email?
* Suggestions:
  * Alternative channel for contacting the admin team. (email/contact form, etc.)
  * An appeals process.
  * A separate mediator office/officer/collection of volunteers.
  * A separate advocate through which a banned member could reach the admin team? Diffferent from mediatiors?
  * Have admins who did not agree with the ban advocate for the member.
  * An audience with the community to hear the banning reasons, and codes violated cited and clear.
  * Be able to state your case.
  * Some way to communicate that does not depend on the slack. email, twitter, etc.
  * Admin(s) who banned, if the ban is lifted, should have repercussions.
  * Volunteers to pass messages on to the admin team for people outside the slack. (self doxxing/outing concerns?)
